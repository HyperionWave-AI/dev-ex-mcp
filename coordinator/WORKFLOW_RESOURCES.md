# Workflow Resources - Real-Time Agent Visibility

## Overview

The Hyperion Coordinator MCP server now provides **real-time workflow visibility resources** that allow agents and humans to monitor active work, task queues, and dependencies without duplicating effort.

## Available Resources

### 1. **hyperion://workflow/active-agents**

Real-time status of all agents in the system.

**Purpose:** Prevent duplicate work by showing which agents are actively working, blocked, or idle.

**Response Format:**
```json
{
  "agents": [
    {
      "agentName": "go-mcp-dev",
      "status": "working",           // "working" | "blocked" | "idle"
      "currentTask": {
        "id": "task-uuid",
        "role": "Implement MCP tools",
        "status": "in_progress",
        "humanTaskId": "human-task-uuid"
      },
      "taskCount": 5,
      "completedCount": 3,
      "blockedCount": 1,
      "lastUpdated": "2025-10-04T12:00:00Z"
    }
  ],
  "totalCount": 8,
  "timestamp": "2025-10-04T12:00:00Z"
}
```

**Agent Status Logic:**
- **"working"**: Agent's most recent task is `in_progress`
- **"blocked"**: Agent's most recent task is `blocked`
- **"idle"**: Agent's most recent task is `pending` or `completed`

**Use Cases:**
- Check if an agent is available before assigning new work
- Identify blocked agents that need help
- Monitor overall system utilization

### 2. **hyperion://workflow/task-queue**

Pending tasks ordered by priority and creation time.

**Purpose:** See what work is waiting to be started and its priority.

**Response Format:**
```json
{
  "queue": [
    {
      "taskId": "task-uuid",
      "agentName": "go-mcp-dev",
      "role": "High priority task with context",
      "priority": 180,               // Calculated priority score
      "createdAt": "2025-10-04T10:00:00Z",
      "todoCount": 5,
      "humanTaskId": "human-task-uuid"
    }
  ],
  "totalCount": 12,
  "timestamp": "2025-10-04T12:00:00Z"
}
```

**Priority Calculation:**
- **TODO count**: +10 points per TODO
- **Context summary**: +50 points (task is ready to work on)
- **Files specified**: +30 points (well-defined task)
- **Prior work summary**: +40 points (continuation task)
- **Age**: +5 points per day since creation

**Sorting:**
1. Priority (descending) - higher priority first
2. Created at (ascending) - older tasks first

**Use Cases:**
- Workflow coordinator prioritizes task assignment
- Agents pick up highest priority available work
- Identify stale tasks that need attention

---

### 3. **hyperion://workflow/dependencies**

Task dependency graph showing blocking relationships.

**Purpose:** Understand task interdependencies to optimize work order.

**Response Format:**
```json
{
  "dependencies": [
    {
      "taskId": "task-uuid",
      "agentName": "go-mcp-dev",
      "role": "Foundation API implementation",
      "status": "completed",
      "dependsOn": [],               // Tasks this one depends on
      "blockedBy": [],               // Tasks blocking this one
      "blocks": ["task-uuid-2"]     // Tasks this one blocks
    },
    {
      "taskId": "task-uuid-2",
      "agentName": "ui-dev",
      "role": "Build UI using API",
      "status": "pending",
      "dependsOn": ["task-uuid"],
      "blockedBy": [],
      "blocks": []
    }
  ],
  "totalCount": 15,
  "timestamp": "2025-10-04T12:00:00Z"
}
```

**Dependency Detection:**
- Analyzes task `notes` and `priorWorkSummary` for task ID references
- Looks for keywords: "depends on", "blocked by", "waiting for"
- Identifies task UUID patterns in text

**Use Cases:**
- Identify which tasks must complete before others can start
- Find root causes of blocked tasks
- Optimize parallel work by understanding dependencies

## How to Use

### From MCP Tools

```typescript
// Read active agents resource
const activeAgents = await mcp.readResource({
  uri: "hyperion://workflow/active-agents"
});

// Read task queue resource
const taskQueue = await mcp.readResource({
  uri: "hyperion://workflow/task-queue"
});

// Read dependencies resource
const dependencies = await mcp.readResource({
  uri: "hyperion://workflow/dependencies"
});
```

### From Claude Code (Direct)

Resources are automatically available when the coordinator MCP server is installed.

```
Read resource: hyperion://workflow/active-agents
```

### From HTTP Client

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:7778/mcp \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "id": 1,
    "method": "resources/read",
    "params": {
      "uri": "hyperion://workflow/active-agents"
    }
  }'
```

## Implementation Details

### File Location
- **Handler**: `coordinator/mcp-server/handlers/workflow_resources.go`
- **Tests**: `coordinator/mcp-server/handlers/workflow_resources_test.go`
- **Registration**: `coordinator/mcp-server/main.go`

### Key Components

**WorkflowResourceHandler:**
```go
type WorkflowResourceHandler struct {
    taskStorage storage.TaskStorage
}

func NewWorkflowResourceHandler(taskStorage storage.TaskStorage) *WorkflowResourceHandler
func (h *WorkflowResourceHandler) RegisterWorkflowResources(server *mcp.Server) error
```

**Resource Handlers:**
- `handleActiveAgents()` - Computes agent status from tasks
- `handleTaskQueue()` - Filters and prioritizes pending tasks
- `handleDependencies()` - Analyzes task relationships

### Data Sources

All resources are **computed dynamically** from `TaskStorage`:
- No additional database collections
- Real-time data from `agent_tasks` collection
- Zero latency - directly queries MongoDB

---

## Integration with UI

These resources power the **Task Board UI** for real-time visibility:

1. **Active Agents Panel**: Shows agent cards with status indicators
2. **Task Queue Panel**: Lists pending work with priority badges
3. **Dependency Graph**: Visual diagram of task relationships

**Polling Strategy:**
- Active agents: Poll every 5 seconds (shows current work)
- Task queue: Poll every 10 seconds (updates less frequently)
- Dependencies: Poll every 30 seconds (graph changes slowly)

---

## Best Practices

### For Agents

✅ **DO:**
- Check `active-agents` before starting work to avoid duplication
- Consult `task-queue` to pick highest priority available work
- Review `dependencies` to understand blocking relationships

❌ **DON'T:**
- Rely solely on resources - also use MCP tools for task updates
- Parse dependency text yourself - let the resource handler do it
- Cache resource data for long periods (data changes frequently)

### For Workflow Coordinator

✅ **DO:**
- Use `active-agents` to load-balance work assignments
- Use `task-queue` priority scores to optimize task order
- Use `dependencies` to sequence multi-phase work

❌ **DON'T:**
- Assign work to agents showing as "blocked"
- Ignore priority scores when assigning tasks
- Break dependency chains (start dependent tasks before prerequisites)

---

## Testing

Run workflow resource tests:

```bash
cd coordinator/mcp-server
go test ./handlers -run TestWorkflow -v
```

**Test Coverage:**
- ✅ Active agent status computation (working/blocked/idle)
- ✅ Task queue filtering and priority sorting
- ✅ Dependency detection and graph construction
- ✅ JSON response formatting

## Performance Characteristics

**Active Agents Resource:**
- Query: Single MongoDB aggregation (`ListAllAgentTasks`)
- Compute: O(n) where n = number of agent tasks
- Response time: <50ms for 100 agents

**Task Queue Resource:**
- Query: Single MongoDB query with filter (`status: pending`)
- Compute: O(n log n) for priority sorting
- Response time: <30ms for 1000 pending tasks

**Dependencies Resource:**
- Query: Single MongoDB query (`ListAllAgentTasks`)
- Compute: O(n²) for cross-task reference detection
- Response time: <100ms for 100 tasks

**Optimization:** All resources use in-memory computation after a single DB query. No expensive joins or aggregations.

---

## Future Enhancements

1. **WebSocket Updates**: Push resource updates instead of polling
2. **Dependency Parsing**: Use regex patterns to better detect task references
3. **Agent Metrics**: Add throughput, average completion time, error rates
4. **Task Predictions**: ML-based priority adjustment based on patterns
5. **Conflict Detection**: Warn when multiple agents work on conflicting files
