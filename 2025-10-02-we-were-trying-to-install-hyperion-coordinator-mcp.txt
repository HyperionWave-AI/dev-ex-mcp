> we were trying to install hyperion-coordinator mcp via docker. The docker container is now running but the mcp is not connecting. The install script is in the root of the 
project. It has already been run. Can you debug why claude code is not connecting to the mcp hosted on docker 

⏺ I'll help debug the MCP connection issue with the Docker container. Let me investigate the current state.

⏺ Bash(docker ps --filter "name=hyperion" --format "table {{.Names}}\t{{.Status}}\t{{.Ports}}")

⏺ The Docker container is running and healthy, but Claude Code is trying to use docker-compose run (stdio transport) instead of connecting to the already-running container.
  Let me check the Claude Code config and the docker-compose file:

⏺ Read(~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json)
  ⎿  Read 14 lines (ctrl+o to expand)

⏺ Read(docker-compose.yml)
  ⎿  Read 31 lines (ctrl+o to expand)

⏺ I found the issue! The Claude Code config is set to use docker-compose run which creates a new temporary container each time, but you have a persistent container already 
  running. The MCP server uses stdio transport, so it needs to either:

  1. Connect to the running container via exec (recommended for persistent container)
  2. Use the run command (creates temporary containers each time)

  Since you have a persistent container running, let's fix the Claude Code config to use docker exec:

⏺ Update(~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json)
  ⎿  Updated ../../../Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json with 5 additions and 6 removals
        1    {
        2      "mcpServers": {
        3        "hyperion-coordinator": {
        4 -        "command": "docker-compose",
        4 +        "command": "docker",
        5          "args": [
        6 -          "-f",
        7 -          "/Users/alcwynparker/Documents/2025/2025-09-30-dev-ex-mcp/docker-compose.yml",
        8 -          "run",
        9 -          "--rm",
       10 -          "hyperion-coordinator-mcp"
        6 +          "exec",
        7 +          "-i",
        8 +          "hyperion-coordinator-mcp",
        9 +          "/app/hyperion-coordinator-mcp"
       10          ]
       11        }
       12      }

⏺ Fixed! The issue was that Claude Code was configured to use docker-compose run which creates a new temporary container each time, but you need to connect to the
  already-running container using docker exec.

  What changed:
  - docker-compose run --rm → docker exec -i hyperion-coordinator-mcp
  - This connects to your persistent running container instead of spawning new ones

  Next step: Restart Claude Code (fully quit and reopen) to load the new MCP configuration.

  The container is healthy and ready - once you restart Claude Code, it should connect successfully to the MCP server.
